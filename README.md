## About Appraised
<p>
Appraised is a real estate web application aimed at publicizing data that is highly privatized in the real estate industry and makes finding data and doing market value comparisons simple. Users can look at our data-filled interactive maps to find out real estate data and historic price data in a region to determine whether a property is a good value or not. Registered users have access to a personal watchlist that they can add and remove properties from.
